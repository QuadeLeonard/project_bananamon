# Project Bananamon
## Description:
  Our basic idea was to determine various factors of pokemon given their base stats. These factors include their type, BMI, and the generation they come from. There are two machine learning algorithms used in this project: neural networks and decision trees.

## Installation:
  - Python 3.7 or higher required. 
  - Using the Python pip installer, you must install various packages;
    - `pip install tensorflow`
    - `pip install numpy`
    - `pip install pdb`
    - `pip install Pillow`
    - `pip install tkinter`
    - `pip install matplotlib`
    - `pip install sklearn`
  - To run the program, the user can use any typical method, however using the git bash is recommended
## Usage and Project Structure:
  - There are 3 separate code files which can be run independently depending on what you want to see:
    - `BMIPrediction.py` located in `~/`
